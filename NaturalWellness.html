            <h5 class="card-title">Nutrition</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Nutrition plays an important part in our overall journey to healthy living. You are either building your body up or tearing it down with what you consume through your mouth. You are what you eat, and studies have suggested that those who consume high portions of fast food are more likely to be depressed that those who eat fresh produce. Processed sugars and refined carbs spike the risk for someone to have depression, if they are a major part of their diet. To combat a poor diet, try eating foods kissed by the sun, fruits and vegetables. The radiance they receive, you will feel.</p>

            <p class="card-text"> Some may find it hard to add fresh fruit and vegetable to their lifestyle. One way to receive the nutrients your body needs, is to drink one smoothie a day. Adding a sea moss gel to it will combat bacteria, fungus, and infections in the body.
            Out of the 102 essential minerals our body is made of, 92 of them are stored within Irish Moss. Better known as Sea Moss. 
            Benefits of digesting this wonder plant include being a natural decongestant, a digestive aid and all around immune booster.
            Sea Moss taste likes the ocean, therefore the best way to digest this power packed, immune booster is in gel form. A tablespoon or two can be swallowed or added into a smoothie of your choice.
            Sea Moss gel can be made in the comfort of your kitchen. Vegan with Curves can show you how ( <a href="https://veganwithcurves.com/sea-moss-gel/" target="_blank">Making Sea Moss gel</a>)
